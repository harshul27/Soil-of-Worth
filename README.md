# 🌱 Soil of Worth (SoW) – Empowering Indian Agriculture with Data Science

### 🧠 "SoW" is a Machine Learning-based tool to analyze soil fertility and recommend optimal crops for Indian farmlands — a data-driven step towards agricultural empowerment and sustainability.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

India, where agriculture sustains a major share of the population, is witnessing a decline in traditional farming practices due to urbanization, environmental degradation, and insufficient access to scientific farming insights.

**Soil of Worth (SoW)** is a machine learning-powered system that:
- **Grades soil** based on macro and micronutrient analysis.
- **Recommends the best-suited crops** for a particular soil type and region.
- **Predicts crop yields** and **suggests fertilizer usage**.
- **Visualizes optimal growing regions** on the Indian map.
- **Provides an interactive web interface** to democratize this information for farmers and policymakers alike.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional soil testing methods are:
- Expensive and time-consuming.
- Dependent on manual labor and expert interpretation.
- Prone to inaccuracy due to sample timing, depth, and location.

In contrast, our ML-based approach offers:
- Faster, scalable, and **automated** soil fertility prediction.
- **Tailored crop suggestions** with region-specific insights.
- **Price prediction features** to help farmers understand their produce's market value.

---

## 🚀 Objectives

1. **Automate soil analysis** using ML algorithms.
2. **Predict optimal crops** for specific soil and climate conditions.
3. **Support farmers’ decision-making** with data-driven insights.
4. **Visualize predictions** via a user-friendly interactive map and web portal.
